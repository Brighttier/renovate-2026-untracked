## 💰 Cost vs Value

### Cost Impact
- **Blueprint generation**: 5-7x more expensive per API call
- **Per website**: $0.05-0.14 (vs $0.01-0.02 before)

### Value Impact
- **Fewer regenerations**: Higher quality = less "try again"
- **Faster client approval**: Professional results = quicker sign-offs
- **Higher perceived value**: Premium sites justify higher prices
- **Less manual editing**: More time for client acquisition

### ROI Example
```
Old system:
- Cost per website: $0.02
- Regenerations needed: 3-5 times
- Manual editing: 30-60 minutes
- Time to client approval: Days
- Total cost: $0.06-0.10 + 45 min labor

New system:
- Cost per website: $0.05-0.14
- Regenerations needed: 0-1 times
- Manual editing: 0-10 minutes
- Time to client approval: Hours
- Total cost: $0.05-0.14 + 5 min labor

Result: FASTER + BETTER + LESS WORK

## 📈 Success Indicators

### You'll know it's working when you see:

1. **Headlines that make you stop scrolling**
   - "Get the Smile You've Always Wanted—Pain-Free, Same-Day Results"
   - NOT "Welcome to Smith Dental"

   - "Get My Free Smile Analysis"
   - NOT "Contact Us"

3. **Copy that sells benefits**
   - "Walk out 8 shades brighter in 60 minutes"
   - NOT "We offer teeth whitening"

4. **Colors that match the industry**
   - Blues/greens for medical (trust, care)
   - Oranges/reds for food (appetite, warmth)
   - Greens/blacks for fitness (energy, power)

5. **Professional logos**
   - Extracted from business photos or AI-generated
   - Not just text and colors

6. **Zero placeholder text**
   - Every word is final-ready
   - No "Your business description here"

7. **Team approval without editing**
   - Sites look professional immediately
   - Clients love them on first view
