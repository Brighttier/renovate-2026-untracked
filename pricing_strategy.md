## 6. CFO Recommendations (Optimization Strategy)

1. **Model Routing**: Currently, we use Gemini 3 Flash for most tasks. Implementing more aggressive caching for repetitive site generation prompts could reduce API costs by another 15-20%.
2. **Enterprise Floor**: The Enterprise tier margin (88.7%) is the lowest. We should monitor "Unlimited" usage patterns closely. The current limit of 500 sites is safe, but "true" unlimited should be avoided to prevent API arbitrage.
3. **Marketplace Scaling**: The Marketplace fees represent pure profit with near-zero COGS. Increasing the "Attach Rate" of these services to standard site generations is the fastest way to increase ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).
4. **Token Burn Policy**: Consider implementing "Token Expiry" at the end of billing cycles for Starter/Growth plans to further optimize the liability side of the balance sheet.
